# rsync-time-backup
A simple script to backup a directory with rsync and hardlinks, inspired by Backintime

This script is mainly inspired by Backintime (https://github.com/bit-team/backintime), but is a mix between two other scripts (https://netfuture.ch/2013/08/simple-versioned-timemachine-like-backup-using-rsync/ and https://github.com/samdoran/rsync-time-machine)

To use it: rsync-time-backup.sh <src> <dst> <label>
